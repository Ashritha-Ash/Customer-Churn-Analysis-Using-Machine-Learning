# Customer-Churn-Analysis-Using-Machine-Learning

1. This project focuses on predicting customer churn using machine learning techniques.
2. A synthetic customer dataset is created programmatically within the notebook.
3. The dataset contains demographic, service, and payment-related features.
4. Data preprocessing includes encoding categorical variables and scaling features.
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand churn patterns.
6. Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest models are trained.
7. Model performance is evaluated using accuracy and classification reports.
8. Random Forest provides the best prediction performance.
9. Contract type, monthly charges, and tenure are key churn factors.
10. The project helps businesses design effective customer retention strategies.
